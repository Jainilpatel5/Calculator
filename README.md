# Calculator
 The Virtual Calculator project developed using HTML and CSS aims to create a user interface mirroring a physical calculator but operates within a web browser. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) provides the structure of the calculator interface, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling and layout.
